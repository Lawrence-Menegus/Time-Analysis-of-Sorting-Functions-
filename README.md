# Sorting Algorithm Runtime Analysis

<p>This project calculates the runtime functions of various sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Radix Sort. The runtimes are measured with array sizes: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 8192, and 16384 filled with random values.</p>

### Here's a brief breakdown of the program:
<b>Selection Sort</b>: Measures the runtime for Selection Sort on arrays of various sizes.
<b>Bubble Sort</b>: Measures the runtime for Bubble Sort on arrays of various sizes.
<b>Insertion Sort</b>: Measures the runtime for Insertion Sort on arrays of various sizes.
<b>Merge Sort</b>: Measures the runtime for Merge Sort on arrays of various sizes.
<b>Quick Sort</b>: Measures the runtime for Quick Sort on arrays of various sizes.
<b>Radix Sort</b>: Measures the runtime for Radix Sort on arrays of various sizes.
